  iptables-persistent has become a native package (meaning there is no
  upstream tarball). In its present form, iptables-persistent is unlikely
  to be useful outside Debian or Debian-derivatives, and I do not plan to
  include any support for other distributions, so a native package makes the
  maintenance overhead considerably smaller.
