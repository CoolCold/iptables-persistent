The Debian Package iptables-persistent
----------------------------

This is a very simple script that restores the file /etc/iptables/rules as
the active ruleset at system boot.

If it exists, IPv6 rules are also restored from /etc/iptables/rules.v6

Loading of rules is guaranteed to happen before network interfaces are
brought up.

To save the current ruleset, use "iptables-save >/etc/iptables/rules"
or "ip6tables-save >/etc/iptables/rules.v6"
